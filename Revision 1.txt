aymptotic notation
big o, omega, theta, recurrence relation
trees, stack, array, AVL tree, hash function types, types of queue, Heap operations (find, insert, delete, meld, merge, replace, empty)
parent of a child in heap is floor(i/2)

max heapify(i)
i=left, r=right,
if l<=a.heap-size and a[l] > a[i]
larget=l
else largest=i
if r<=a.heap-size and ar]>a[largest]
largest=r
if largest!=i
swap(largest,i)
max heapify(largest)

largest element ko last vale se swap kardo
fir max heapfiy kardo last ko exclude karke
Algo:
1. build max heap
2. for a.length se 2 tak
	swap 1st and a[last], maximum banda last jayega
	a.heap-size--
	maxheapify(a,1) matlab 1 se start karo aur pura array maxheap karo

bucket sort:
1. make new array of that size
2. fill that array with a, indexing floor(n(a[i])
3. insertion sort if necessary
Bucket, Radix, and counting sort

inorder:
curr = head
while(curr!=NULL or !s.empty())
	while(curr!=NULL)
		s.push(curr)
		curr = curr->left, push to the leftest

	curr = s.top()
	cout<< curr
	s.pop()
	curr = curr->right
**
while(curr!=NULL and !s.empty())
	//Traverse to the leftest node
	cout s.top and pop
	curr = curr->right
**
preorder:
st.push(root)
while(!s.empty())
	node = s.top()
	cout data
	s.pop()

	if(node->right)	push right
	if(node->left) push left
1) print the top element and pop
2) push right element
3) push left element

postorder:
if !root return list

Switching:
1. Circuit
CONNECTION ORIENTED
connection pre established
make diagram
once a connection is established, we cannot send any other data in it, just like a phone call.
No delay.
Connection time waste
Circuit switched network is MADE OF A SET OF SWITCHES connected by physical links, each of which are divided into multiple channels
phases: Connection establish, message send, connection break
Routing is done using FDM: frequency division multiplexing, and tdm: time division multiplexing


2. Message
CONNECTION ORIENTED
message is sent
also called store and forward switching
message is only forwarded if destination has empty space
message contains source and destination address.
Delay if destination doesnt have space.
Large storage capacity required

3. Packet switching
Message is broken down into number of packets which take different and optimised roots. Pretty efficient

Virtual packet switching: Logical connection is established before.
Datagram packet switching
