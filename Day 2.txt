CP~~:
//We want the same digits TO BE FAR from each, as far as they can be coz for 2 letters to be a pleasant pair IF ONE OF THE MIDDLE 2 ELEMENTS IS DIFFERENT FROM THE bounding pair elements
/*
ddedf
Counting good pairs:
Same ones:
1. dd
2. dd
3. dd
Pleasant:
4. ddedf
5. dedf
6. edf

So. 6

For dfded
1. dfd
2. dfde
3. dfded
4. fde
5. fded
6. ded

So, 6, BUT UK WE GET THE IDEA. Similar elements need to be AS FAR AS POSSIBLE, otherwise pleasant vale main same aa jayega
*/
Algo:
1. Sort
2. Keep c outing the first and last elements
3. if l==r cout<<s[l] too, when s.length is odd

CN~~:
Data flow:
1. Simplex: Only sending of data
2. Half Duplex: Single direction of data flow, but both ways
3. Full Duplex: Dono side ko data flow karta hai

Types of connections:
1. point-to-point: From node to node
2. Multipoint: From one node to multiple nodes

Broadcast Networks:
1. 1km: LAN
2. 10KM: MAN
3. 1000KM: WAN

Network devices:
1. Switch: Connects devices on same network. Eg.LAN Forwards data
2. Router: Connects MULTIPLE NETWORKS together, eg. home to internet. Uses IP address to determine path. Eg. using internet
3. Hub: It BROADCASTS incoming data to ALL CONNECTED DEVICES. Rest same like switch. No one uses it nowadays
4. Amplifier: Increases frequency of signal in case of loss. Increases strength
5. Repeater: COPIES SIGNAL and repeats it increases distance of signal, thats why calls repeater, IT DOESNT LET THE STRENGTH DECREASE
6. Gateway: Acts as GATE BETWEEN 2 NETWORKS. Translating data BETWEEN PROTOCOLS, eg. from an internal protocol to internet (HTTP)
7. Bridge: CONNECTS 2 OR MORE NETWORK SEGMENTS, within same TYPE of network, FILTERS TRAFFIC based on mac address. Used to divide LARGE NETWORK into smaller managable segments

Transmission Media classes:
1. Guided: Twisted: STP, UTP, Coaxial: Broadband, Baseband, Fiber optic cable
2. Unguided
